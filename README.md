# Investment Strategy With Self Organizing Kohonens Maps

### Aim of The Project
The purpose of the following work is to create an investment strategy operating on the historical data from the Polish stock exchange. Such a system may support decisions making by the human during investments on a stock market. 

The following problem will be solved by the usage of unsupervised clustering algorithm bases on the neural networks - **Self-organizing Kohonen Maps**. Its adventage comparing to the supervised algorithms, is that it doesn't require labeled data. Due to that fact, the system will be resistent for incorrectly labeled rows, which may be a popular issue in this type of problems.
